# Stamp-Duty-and-Land-Tax
R Shiny dashboard created during internship at the Australian Taxpayers' Alliance to demonstrate how long it would take broadened-base land tax to overtake stamp duty.
It was used as a demonstration tool in the 2020 ATA campaign to abolish stamp duty and broaden land tax instead, a policy that was partially adopted by the NSW State Government.

Assumptions used:
* House price predicts land value (linear regression)
* No inflation
* 3.6% interest rate on mortgage
* Tax rates and brackets do not change from 2020
